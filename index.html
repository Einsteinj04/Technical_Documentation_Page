          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS
          basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer
          questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display
          at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my
          webpage with background images and colors?
        </p>
      </section>

        <header>What You Should Know</header>
        <p>
          Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup
          language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to
          selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects
          paragraph text, setting the color to red:
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>

          p { 
            color:red; 
          } 
          </pre>
        </code>
        <p>
          Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS
          (above) into a new file. Save the file as style.css in a directory
          named styles. To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS
          (above) to your HTML document. Otherwise, the styling won't change the
          appearance of the HTML.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Open your index.html file. Paste the following line in the head
            (between the
            <head>
              and
            </head>
            tags):
          </li>
          <code> &lt;link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt; </code>
          <li>
            Save index.html and load it in your browser. You should see
            something like this:
          </li>
          <img
            src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/website-screenshot-styled.png"
            alt="The browser window"
          />
        </ol>
        <p>
          If your paragraph text is red, congratulations! Your CSS is working.
        </p>
        <h2>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h2>
        <p>
          Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it
          works :
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png"
          alt="Anatomy of a CSS ruleset"
        />
        <p>
          The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often
          referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:
          Selector This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It
          defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example,
        </p>

        <p>
          elements). To style a different element, change the selector.
          Declaration This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which
          of the element's properties you want to style. Properties These are
          ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color
          is a property of the
        </p>

        <p>
          elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in
          the rule. Property value To the right of the property—after the
          colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many
          possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are
          many color values in addition to red.) Note the other important parts
          of the syntax:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly
            braces. ({})
          </li>
          <li>
            Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the
            property from its value or values.
          </li>
          <li>
            Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each
            declaration from the next one.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them
          separated by semicolons, like this:
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
          p {
            color: red;
            width: 500px;
            border: 1px solid black;
          }
          </pre>
        </code>
        <h2>Selecting multiple elements</h2>
        <p>
          You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to
          all of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas. For example:
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
          p, li, h1 {
            color: red;
          }
          </pre>
        </code>
        <h2>Different types of selectors</h2>
        <p>
          There are many different types of selectors. The examples above use
          element selectors, which select all elements of a given type. But we
          can make more specific selections as well. Here are some of the more
          common types of selectors:
        </p>
        <table></table>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Fonts_and_Text">
        <header>Fonts and Text</header>
        <p>
          Now that we've explored some CSS fundamentals, let's improve the
          appearance of the example by adding more rules and information to the
          style.css file.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            First, find the output from Google Fonts that you previously saved
            from What will your website look like?. Add the <link /> element
            somewhere inside your index.html's head (anywhere between the
            <head>
              and
            </head>
            tags). It looks something like this:
            <!-- <code>
              &lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css family=Open+Sans"
              rel="stylesheet"&gt;
            </code> -->
            This code links your page to a style sheet that loads the Open Sans
            font family with your webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, delete the existing rule you have in your style.css file. It
            was a good test, but let's not continue with lots of red text.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the following lines (shown below), replacing the font-family
            assignment with your font-family selection from What will your
            website look like?. The property font-family refers to the font(s)
            you want to use for text. This rule defines a global base font and
            font size for the whole page. Since &lt;html&gt; is the parent
            element of the whole page, all elements inside it inherit the same
            font-size and font-family.
          </li>
          <code>
            <pre>

          html {
            font-size: 10px;
            font-family: 'Open Sans';

          }
          p, li, h1 {
              color: red;
          }
            </pre>
          </code>
          <li>
            Now let's set font sizes for elements that will have text inside the
            HTML body (&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, and &lt;pGt;). We'll also center
            the heading. Finally, let's expand the second ruleset (below) with
            settings for line height and letter spacing to make body content
            more readable.
          </li>
          <code>
            <pre>
          h1 { 
            font-size: 60px; 
            text-align: center;
          } 
          p, li { 
            font-size: 16px; 
            line-height: 2; 
            letter-spacing: 1px; 
          }
            </pre>
          </code>
          <p>Adjust the px values as you like.</p>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="CSS:_All_about_boxes">
        <header>CSS: All about boxes</header>
        <p>
          Something you'll notice about writing CSS: a lot of it is about boxes.
          This includes setting size, color, and position. Most HTML elements on
          your page can be thought of as boxes sitting on top of other boxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS layout is mostly based on the box model. Each box taking up space
          on your page has properties like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            padding, the space around the content. In the example below, it is
            the space around the paragraph text.
          </li>
          <li>border, the solid line that is just outside the padding.</li>
          <li>margin, the space around the outside of the border.</li>
        </ul>

          alt="CSS Box model"
        />
        <p>In this section we also use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>width (of an element).</li>
          <li>
            background-color, the color behind an element's content and padding.
          </li>
          <li>color, the color of an element's content (usually text).</li>
          <li>text-shadow sets a drop shadow on the text inside an element.</li>
          <li>display sets the display mode of an element.</li>
        </ul>
